# Data: 'Norena.txt'  from Torices & MÃ©ndez (2014)
# This data set represents the dry mass (in grames) of inflorescence components of the sunflower species Tussilago farfara
# The inflorescences were dissected in 'SCAPE', 'RECEPTACLE', 'MALEFL' (male flowers), 'OVAR' (reproductive part of female flowers), 
# and 'RAYS' (the petaloid ray of female flower). Furthermore in the last column the total weight of the inflorescence is added 'TOTALSIZE'

traits<-read.table ("Norena.txt", sep="\t", header=T)


# To estimate 'classic' phenotypic integration indices based on the variance of the eigenvalues:
intphen (traits[,1:5]) # the last column is not included since represents the total size

# [1] "INT (Phenotypic integration index) =   1.06"
# [1] "RelINT (% of maximum possible integration) =  26.489"
# [1] "INT.c (Corrected phenotypic integration index) =  0.922"
# [1] "RelINT.c (% of maximum possible integration) =  23.04"
# [1] "Number of observations used =  29"

# NOTE that the number of observations used by the function was 29 instead 40 that were included in the 'Norena' data set. 
# Missing (NAs) values were removed. 


# To assess the statistical significance of these indices: Is INT significantly different from 0?
intphen.boot(traits[,1:5], 5000)

# Yes, it is!!!

intphen.par(traits)
